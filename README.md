# Stock Forecaster 
By - Mohammed Aljubori

This is the backend to a full stack python applicaion that I worked on in a group setting. Since I worked on the backend, that is what is uploaded here.

# Description 
This application connects to Yahoo Finance API to get real life data. Part of this app is to display all of the different information based on the user requirements like: top stocks for the day, worst stocks for the day, as well as historical data. <br>  <br>Another requirement was to forecast stocks in the near future, and for that I implemented a Exponential Moving Average algorithm that takes in the historical data and gives out a forecast for the given company.
